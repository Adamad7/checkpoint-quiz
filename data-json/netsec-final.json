    ],
    "explanation": "There are many differences between a stateless and stateful firewall.\nStateless firewalls (packet filtering firewalls):\n        – are susceptible to IP spoofing\n        – do not reliably filter fragmented packets\n        – use complex ACLs, which can be difficult to implement and maintain\n        – cannot dynamically filter certain services\n        – examine each packet individually rather than in the context of the state of a connection\n    \nStateful firewalls:\n        – are often used as a primary means of defense by filtering unwanted, unnecessary, or undesirable\n        traffic\n        – strengthen packet filtering by providing more stringent control over security\n        – improve performance over packet filters or proxy servers\n        – defend against spoofing and DoS attacks by determining whether packets belong to an existing connection\n        or are from an unauthorized source\n        – provide more log information than a packet filtering firewall"
