<p><strong>1. Which are two best practices used to secure APIs? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="correct_answer">use reputable and standard libraries to create the APIs</li>
<li class="correct_answer">make internal API documentation mandatory</li>
<li>discussing company API development (or any other application development) on public forums</li>
<li>secure API services to provide HTTP endpoints only</li>
<li>keep API implementation and API security into one tier allowing the API developer to work on both facets simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The following are several general best practices and recommendations for securing APIs:<br />
&#8211; Secure API services to provide HTTPS endpoints with only a strong version of TLS.<br />
&#8211; Validate parameters in the application and sanitize incoming data from API clients.<br />
&#8211; Explicitly scan for common attack signatures; injection attacks often betray themselves by following common patterns.<br />
&#8211; Use strong authentication and authorization standards.<br />
&#8211; Use reputable and standard libraries to create the APIs.<br />
&#8211; Segment API implementation and API security into distinct tiers; doing so frees up the API developer to focus completely on the application domain.<br />
&#8211; Identify what data should be publicly available and what information is sensitive.<br />
&#8211; If possible, have a security expert do the API code verification.<br />
&#8211; Make internal API documentation mandatory.<br />
&#8211; Avoid discussing company API development (or any other application development) on a public forum.</p></div>
<p><strong>2. Which type of threat actors use cybercrime attacks to promote what they believe in?</strong></p><div class="92f2483bb651eed307c93e619d752c78" data-index="2" style="float: none; margin:10px 0 10px 0; text-align:center;">

<ul>
<li>state-sponsored</li>
<li class="correct_answer">hacktivists</li>
<li>organized crime</li>
<li>insider threats</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Hacktivists are types of threat actors not motivated by money. Hacktivists are looking to make a point or to promote what they believe, using cybercrime as a method of attack. These types of attacks are often carried out by stealing sensitive data and then revealing it to the public to embarrass or financially affect a target.</p></div>
<p><strong>3. A company conducted a penetration test 6 months ago. However, they have acquired new firewalls and servers to strengthen the network and increase capacity. Why would an administrator request a new penetration test?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="correct_answer">The attack surface has changed with the new equipment added.</li>
<li>The servers require independent performance evaluation.</li>
<li>The core data has been moved to the cloud infrastructure.</li>
<li>New cloud-based applications have been implemented.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Implementing a firewall, an IPS, anti-malware, a VPN, a web application firewall (WAF), and other modern security defenses is not enough. The validity of these defensive techniques needs to be tested regularly. As networks and systems change, the attack surface can vary as well, and when it does, the reevaluation of the security posture must be conducted by way of a penetration test.</p></div>
<p><strong>4. A network administrator performs a penetration test for a company that sells computer parts through an online storefront. The first step is to discover who owns the domain name that the company is using. Which penetration testing tool can be used to do this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>h8mail</li>
<li>Maltego</li>
<li class="correct_answer">WHOIS</li>
<li>Exif</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The whois command can gather information about who owns a particular domain from public records.</p></div>
<p><strong>5. A penetration tester wants to quickly discover all the live hosts on the 192.168.0.0/24 network. Which command can do the ping sweep using the nmap tool?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>nmap 192.168.1.0/24 -open</li>
<li>nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24</li>
<li>nmap -sV 192.168.0.255</li>
<li class="correct_answer">nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24</li>
<li>nmap -p 1-65535 localhost</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The command <b>nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24</b> is used to do a ping sweep of the 192.168.0.0/24 network for active hosts. This basic host discovery scan can be performed to determine what devices on a network are live. Such a scan for host discovery of an entire subnet is sometimes called a ping sweep.</p></div>
<p><strong>6. A penetration tester runs the command nmap -sF -p 80 192.168.1.1 against a Windows host and receives a response RST packet. What conclusion can be drawn on the status of port 80?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="correct_answer">undetermined as this is a default response on a Windows system</li>
<li>port 80 is open</li>
<li>port 80 is closed</li>
<li>port 80 is open/filtered</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> A TCP FIN scan is not useful when scanning Windows-based systems, as they respond with RST packets, regardless of the port state. The normal implication of an RST message would indicate a closed port. Since this is a Windows-based system, it will always respond with an RST message regardless of the port state.</p></div>
<p><strong>7. Which common tool is used by penetration testers to craft packets?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>h8mail</li>
<li>pip3</li>
<li>nmap</li>
<li>Recon-ng</li>
<li class="correct_answer">scapy</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Scapy is a very comprehensive Python-based framework or ecosystem for packet generation. Scapy must be run with root permissions to be able to modify packets.</p></div>
<p><strong>8. Why should a tester use query throttling techniques when running an authorized penetration test on a live network?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to limit bandwidth on resource heavy applications</li>
<li class="correct_answer">to reduce the number of attack threads that are being sent to the target at the same time</li>
<li>to limit bandwidth on real-time antivirus and malware scanners</li>
<li>to create a larger attack surface on the target</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> To work around the issue of bandwidth limitations and vulnerability scanning, slowing down the traffic created by the scanner can help. This is often referred to as query throttling, and it can typically be achieved by modifying the options of the scanning policy. One way to do this is to reduce the number of attack threads being sent to the target simultaneously.</p></div>
<p><strong>9. Why would an organization hire a red team?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to install equipment to protect against physical intrusion</li>
<li class="correct_answer">to play the role of a threat actor by exposing vulnerabilities regarding technology</li>
<li>to defend the organization against cybersecurity threats</li>
<li>to evaluate the work of the security team of the organization</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> A read team is a group of cybersecurity experts and penetration testers hired by an organization to mimic a real threat actor by exposing vulnerabilities and risks regarding technology, people, and physical security.</p></div>

<p><strong>15. Which three practices are commonly adopted when setting up a penetration testing lab environment? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>use a honeypot for all tests run from the physical attack platforms</li>
<li class="correct_answer">ensure that when something crashes, it can be determined how and why it happened</li>
<li class="correct_answer">create the penetration testing environment using virtual machines and virtual switches</li>
<li>use an open environment to allow for free passage of attack packets to the target machines</li>
<li>create the penetration testing environment using physical equipment and switches in order to route the packets freely</li>
<li class="correct_answer">use a closed environment for all testing purposes</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> The following is a list of requirements for a typical penetration testing environment:<br />
&#8211; Closed network: Ensure controlled access to and from the lab environment and restricted access to the Internet.<br />
&#8211; Virtualized computing environment: This allows for easy deployment and recovery of devices being tested.<br />
&#8211; Realistic environment: Using a staging testing environment should match the real environment as closely as possible.<br />
&#8211; Health monitoring: When something crashes, ensure the ability to determine how and why it happened.<br />
&#8211; Sufficient hardware resources: Ensure that a lack of resources does not cause false results.<br />
&#8211; Multiple operating systems: Test or validate a finding from another system. Testing from different operating systems is always good to see if the results differ.<br />
&#8211; Duplicate tools: A great way to validate a finding is to run the same test with a different tool to see if the results are the same.<br />
&#8211; Practice targets: Practice the penetration tools constantly. To do this, practice on targets that are known to be vulnerable.</p></div>
<p><strong>16. An organization wants to test its vulnerability to an employee with network privileges accessing the network maliciously. Which type of penetration test should be used to test this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>white-box</li>
<li>black-box</li>
<li>blue-box</li>
<li class="correct_answer">gray-box</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Gray-box penetration testing is when the test is run from within the internal network. Because most compromises start at the client and work their way throughout the network, a good approach would be a scope where the testers start inside the network and have access to a client machine. Then they could pivot throughout the network to determine the impact of a compromise. Gray-box testing is done in a partially known environment.<br />
In black-box penetration testing, the tester is typically provided only limited information. (Unknown-environment testing.)<br />
In white-box penetration testing, the tester starts with significant information about the organization and its infrastructure. (Totally known environment.)<br />
The blue-box penetration testing is a box containing equipment for field quality testing and screening, with visual and written instructions for the users. CYBRI developed its own penetration testing services technology, called Blue-Box, which helps businesses and experts stay on the same page when it comes to testing, security controls, and security services.</p></div>

<li>scarcity</li>
<li>social proof</li>
<li>fear</li>
<li class="correct_answer">authority</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Social engineers use several motivation techniques/methods of influence. In this scenario, a social engineer explores the principle that a person tends to comply with people in positions of authority, such as doctors, lawyers, and experts in different fields. This is the authority method of influence.</p></div>
<p><strong>23. Which statement correctly describes a type of physical social engineering attack?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dumpster phishing refers to a threat actor who scavenges for victims&#8217; private information in garbage and recycling containers.</li>
<li class="correct_answer">Social engineering techniques, software, and hardware can perform badge cloning attacks.</li>
<li>Tailgating and piggybacking attacks can only be defeated through the use of control vestibules in conjunction with multifactor authentication.</li>
<li>Shoulder surfing attacks are performed only by a short distance between the threat actor and the victim.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> There are various types of physical attacks. Both piggybacking and tailgating can be defeated through the use of access control vestibules, and it is often used in conjunction with multifactor authentication. Turnstiles, double entry doors, and security guards can also eliminate piggybacking and tailgating. With dumpster diving, a person (threat actor) scavenges for victims&#8217; private information in garbage and recycling containers. In badge cloning attacks, specialized software, hardware, and social engineering techniques can be used to perform such attacks. With shoulder surfing, someone obtains information such as personally identifiable information, passwords, and other confidential data by looking not only over the shoulder of the victim. It is also possible to carry out this type of attack from far away using binoculars or even a telescope.</p></div>
