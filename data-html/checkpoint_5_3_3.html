</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> DNS servers using BIND 9.5.0 and higher provide features that help prevent DNS cache
        poisoning attacks. These features include the randomization of ports and provision of cryptographically secure
        DNS transaction identifiers. Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), a technology developed by the
        Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), provides secure DNS data authentication and protects against DNS cache
        poisoning.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The DNS server forward lookup zone is cleared.</li>
    <li>The DNS server reverse lookup zone is cleared.</li>

<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> DNS cache poisoning involves the manipulation of the DNS resolver cache through the injection

<p><strong>8. Which two best practices would help mitigate FTP server abuse and attacks? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>limit anonymous logins to a select group of people</li>
    <li>edit the hosts file to limit the number of authorized DNS servers</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">use encryption at rest</li>

    <li class="correct_answer">require re-authentication of inactive sessions</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The following are several additional best practices for mitigating FTP server abuse and
        attacks:</p>
    <p>&#8211; Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication. A best practice is to use good credential management
        and strong passwords. When possible, use two-factor authentication for any critical service or server.<br />
        &#8211; Implement file and folder security, making sure that users have access to only the files they are
        entitled to access.<br />
        &#8211; Use encryption at rest—encrypt all files stored in the FTP server.<br />
        &#8211; Lock down administration accounts. You should restrict administrator privileges to a limited number of
        users and require them to use multifactor authentication. In addition, do not use common administrator usernames
        such as root or admin.<br />
        &#8211; Keep the FTPS or SFTP server software up-to-date.<br />
        &#8211; Use the U.S. government FIPS 140-2 validated encryption ciphers for general guidance on what encryption
        algorithms to use.<br />
        &#8211; Keep any back-end databases on a different server than the FTP server.<br />
        &#8211; Require re-authentication of inactive sessions.<br />
        &#8211; Disable anonymous logins. </p>
</div>
<p><strong>9. Which is a characteristic of the pass-the-hash attack?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">capture of a password hash (as opposed to the password characters) and using the same
        hashed value for authentication and lateral access to other networked systems</li>
    <li>reverse engineering of the captured hash password and using the unencrypted password for authentication and
        lateral access to other networked systems</li>
    <li>compromise of a SAM file and extraction of the password characters to use for authentication and lateral access
        to other networked systems</li>
    <li>capture of the Windows password before the Kerberos hashing function and use of the unencrypted password for
        authentication and lateral access to other networked systems</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The Windows operating system does not know the actual password because it stores only a hash
        of the password in the SAM database. Since Windows password hashes cannot be reversed, an attacker can just use
        a password hash collected from a compromised system and then use the same hash to log in to another client or
        server system.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>10. What is a Kerberoasting attack?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>It is an attempt to steal the hash value of a user credential and use it to create a new user session on the
        same network.</li>
    <li>It attempts to manipulate Kerberos tickets based on available hashes by compromising a vulnerable system and
        obtaining the local user credentials and password hashes.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">It is a post-exploitation attempt that is used to extract service account credential
        hashes from Active Directory for offline cracking.</li>
    <li>It attempts to manipulate data being transferred by performing data corruption or modification.</li>
</ul>

    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Kerberoasting is a post-exploitation activity used by an attacker to extract service account
        credential hashes from Active Directory for offline cracking. It is a pervasive attack that exploits a
        combination of weak encryption implementations and improper password practices.</p>

<p><strong>22. Which four items are needed by an attacker to create a silver ticket for a Kerberos silver ticket attack?
        (Choose four.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>hash value</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">system account</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">SID</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">FQDN</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">target service</li>
    <li>DNS forward lookup zone</li>
    <li>DNS resolver cache</li>
    <li>DNS reverse lookup zone</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> To create a silver ticket, you need the system account (ending in $), the security identifier
        (SID) for the domain, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), and the given service (for example, CIFS, HOST).
    </p>

<p><strong>23. Which kind of attack is an IP spoofing attack?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">On-path</li>
    <li>DDoS</li>
    <li>Pass-the-Hash</li>
    <li>Evil-Twin</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The On-path attack intercepts communications between two systems. The attacker splits the
        original TCP connection into 2 new connections, one between the client and the attacker and the other between
        the attacker and the server. This often uses IP spoofing to trick a victim into connecting to the attack.</p>

<p><strong>24. What is a common mitigation practice for ARP cache poisoning attacks on switches to prevent spoofing of
        Layer 2 addresses?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>DHCP snooping</li>
    <li>DNSSEC</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">DAI</li>
    <li>BIND 9.5</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> A common mitigation for ARP cache poisoning attacks is to use Dynamic Address Resolution
        Protocol (ARP) Inspection (DAI) on switches to prevent spoofing of the Layer 2 addresses.</p>

<p><strong>25. An attacker is launching a reflected DDoS attack in which the response traffic is made up of packets that
        are much larger than those that the attacker initially sent. Which type of attack is this?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>downgrade</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">amplification</li>
    <li>on-path</li>
    <li>DNS cache poisoning</li>
