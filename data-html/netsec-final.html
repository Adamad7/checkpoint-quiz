<p><strong>2. Which statement describes a difference between the Cisco ASA IOS CLI feature and the router IOS CLI
        feature?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>ASA uses the ? command whereas a router uses the help command to receive help on a brief description and the
        syntax of a command.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">To use a show command in a general configuration mode, ASA can use the command directly
        whereas a router will need to enter the do command before issuing the show command.</li>
    <li>To complete a partially typed command, ASA uses the Ctrl+Tab key combination whereas a router uses the Tab key.
    </li>
    <li>To indicate the CLI EXEC mode, ASA uses the % symbol whereas a router uses the # symbol.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The ASA CLI is a proprietary OS which has a similar look and feel to the Cisco
        router IOS. Although it shares some common features with the router IOS, it has its unique features. For
        example, an ASA CLI command can be executed regardless of the current configuration mode prompt. The IOS do
        command is not required or recognized. Both the ASA CLI and the router CLI use the # symbol to indicate the EXEC
        mode. Both CLIs use the Tab key to complete a partially typed command. Different from the router IOS, the ASA
        provides a help command that provides a brief command description and syntax for certain commands.</p>

    <li>the sequence of servers in the AAA server group</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">the interface name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. What provides both secure segmentation and threat defense in a Secure Data Center solution?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Cisco Security Manager software</li>
    <li>AAA server</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">Adaptive Security Appliance</li>
    <li>intrusion prevention system</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. What are the three core components of the Cisco Secure Data Center solution? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>mesh network</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">secure segmentation</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">visibility</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">threat defense</li>
    <li>servers</li>
    <li>infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Secure segmentation is used when managing and organizing data in a data center.
        Threat defense includes a firewall and intrusion prevention system (IPS). Data center visibility is designed to
        simplify operations and compliance reporting by providing consistent security policy enforcement.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>6. What are three characteristics of ASA transparent mode? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">This mode does not support VPNs, QoS, or DHCP Relay.</li>
    <li>It is the traditional firewall deployment mode.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">This mode is referred to as a &#8220;bump in the wire.&#8221;</li>
    <li>NAT can be implemented between connected networks.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">In this mode the ASA is invisible to an attacker.</li>
    <li>The interfaces of the ASA separate Layer 3 networks and require IP addresses in different subnets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. What is needed to allow specific traffic that is sourced on the outside network of an ASA firewall to
        reach an internal network?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">ACL</li>
    <li>NAT</li>
    <li>dynamic routing protocols</li>
    <li>outside security zone level 0</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In order to explicitly permit traffic from an interface with a lower security level
        to an interface with a higher security level, an ACL must be configured. By default, traffic will only flow from
        a higher security level to a lower.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>8. What will be the result of failed login attempts if the following command is entered into a
        router?</strong></p>
<pre>login block-for 150 attempts 4 within 90</pre>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">All login attempts will be blocked for 150 seconds if there are 4 failed attempts within
        90 seconds.</li>
    <li>All login attempts will be blocked for 90 seconds if there are 4 failed attempts within 150 seconds.</li>
    <li>All login attempts will be blocked for 1.5 hours if there are 4 failed attempts within 150 seconds.</li>
    <li>All login attempts will be blocked for 4 hours if there are 90 failed attempts within 150 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The components of the login block-for 150 attempts 4 within 90 command are as
        follows:<br />
        The expression block-for 150 is the time in seconds that logins will be blocked.<br />
        The expression attempts 4 is the number of failed attempts that will trigger the blocking of login
        requests.<br />
        The expression within 90 is the time in seconds in which the 4 failed attempts must occur.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>9. Which two tasks are associated with router hardening? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>placing the router in a secure room</li>

<p><strong>12. Which three types of traffic are allowed when the authentication port-control auto command has been
        issued and the client has not yet been authenticated? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">CDP</li>
    <li>802.1Q</li>
    <li>IPsec</li>
    <li>TACACS+</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">STP</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">EAPOL</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Until the workstation is authenticated, 802.1X access control enables only
        Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPOL), Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), and Spanning Tree Protocol
        (STP) traffic through the port to which the workstation is connected. After authentication succeeds, normal
        traffic can pass through the port.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>13. Which statement describes a characteristic of the IKE protocol?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">It uses UDP port 500 to exchange IKE information between the security gateways.</li>
    <li>IKE Phase 1 can be implemented in three different modes: main, aggressive, or quick.</li>
    <li>It allows for the transmission of keys directly across a network.</li>
    <li>The purpose of IKE Phase 2 is to negotiate a security association between two IKE peers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14. Which action do IPsec peers take during the IKE Phase 2 exchange?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>exchange of DH keys</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">negotiation of IPsec policy</li>
    <li>negotiation of IKE policy sets</li>
    <li>verification of peer identity</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The IKE protocol executes in two phases. During Phase 1 the two sides negotiate IKE
        policy sets, authenticate each other, and set up a secure channel. During the second phase IKE negotiates
        security associations between the peers.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>15. What are two hashing algorithms used with IPsec AH to guarantee authenticity? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">SHA</li>
    <li>RSA</li>
    <li>DH</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">MD5</li>
    <li>AES</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The IPsec framework uses various protocols and algorithms to provide data
        confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and secure key exchange. Two popular algorithms used to ensure
        that data is not intercepted and modified (data integrity and authenticity) are MD5 and SHA.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>16. Which command raises the privilege level of the ping command to 7?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>user exec ping level 7</li>
    <li>authorization exec ping level 7</li>
    <li>accounting exec level 7 ping</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">privilege exec level 7 ping</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>17. What is a characteristic of a role-based CLI view of router configuration?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>A CLI view has a command hierarchy, with higher and lower views.</li>
    <li>When a superview is deleted, the associated CLI views are deleted.​</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">A single CLI view can be shared within multiple superviews.</li>
    <li>Only a superview user can configure a new view and add or remove commands from the existing views.​</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A CLI view has no command hierarchy, and therefore, no higher or lower views.
        Deleting a superview does not delete the associated CLI views. Only a root view user can configure a new view
        and add or remove commands from the existing views.​</p>
</div>
<p><strong>18. What is a limitation to using OOB management on a large enterprise network?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Production traffic shares the network with management traffic.</li>
    <li>Terminal servers can have direct console connections to user devices needing management.</li>
    <li>OOB management requires the creation of VPNs.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">All devices appear to be attached to a single management network.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> OOB management provides a dedicated management network without production traffic.
        Devices within that network, such as terminal servers, have direct console access for management purposes.
        Because in-band management runs over the production network, secure tunnels or VPNs may be needed. Failures on
        the production network may not be communicated to the OOB network administrator because the OOB management
        network may not be affected</p>
</div>
<p><strong>19. Refer to the exhibit. A corporate network is using NTP to synchronize the time across devices. What can
        be determined from the displayed output?</strong><br />
    <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54660"

</p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">Router03 is a stratum 2 device that can provide NTP service to other devices in the
        network.</li>
    <li>The time on Router03 may not be reliable because it is offset by more than 7 seconds to the time server.</li>
    <li>The interface on Router03 that connects to the time sever has the IPv4 address 209.165.200.225.</li>
    <li>Router03 time is synchronized to a stratum 2 time server.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The <b>show ntp status</b> command displays that Router03 is now a stratum 2 device
        synchronized with the NTP server at 209.165.220.225 and can provide NTP service to other devices in the network.
        The clock offset is only 7.0883 milliseconds, not 7.0883 seconds.</p>

    <li>This message indicates that the interface changed state five times.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">This message is a level 5 notification message.</li>
    <li>This message indicates that the interface should be replaced.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The message is a level 5 notification message as shown in the %LINEPROTO-5 section
        of the output. Messages reporting the link status are common and do not require replacing the interface or
        reconfiguring the interface. The date and time displayed at the beginning of the message indicates that service
        timestamps have been configured on the router.</p>

<p><strong>21. Which two types of hackers are typically classified as grey hat hackers? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">hacktivists</li>
    <li>cyber criminals</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">vulnerability brokers</li>
    <li>script kiddies</li>
    <li>state-sponsored hackers</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Grey hat hackers may do unethical or illegal things, but not for personal gain or
        to cause damage. Hacktivists use their hacking as a form of political or social protest, and vulnerability
        brokers hack to uncover weaknesses and report them to vendors. Depending on the perspective one possesses,
        state-sponsored hackers are either white hat or black hat operators. Script kiddies create hacking scripts to
        cause damage or disruption. Cyber criminals use hacking to obtain financial gain by illegal means.</p>

<ul>
    <li>A virus focuses on gaining privileged access to a device, whereas a worm does not.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">A virus replicates itself by attaching to another file, whereas a worm can replicate
        itself independently.</li>
    <li>A virus can be used to launch a DoS attack (but not a DDoS), but a worm can be used to launch both DoS and DDoS
        attacks.</li>
    <li>A virus can be used to deliver advertisements without user consent, whereas a worm cannot.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Malware can be classified as follows:<br />
        Virus (self-replicates by attaching to another program or file)<br />
        Worm (replicates independently of another program)<br />
        Trojan horse (masquerades as a legitimate file or program)<br />
        Rootkit (gains privileged access to a machine while concealing itself)<br />
        Spyware (collects information from a target system)<br />
        Adware (delivers advertisements with or without consent)<br />
        Bot (waits for commands from the hacker)<br />

<p><strong>23. Which type of packet is unable to be filtered by an outbound ACL?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>multicast packet</li>
    <li>ICMP packet</li>
    <li>broadcast packet</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">router-generated packet</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Traffic that originates within a router such as pings from a command prompt, remote
        access from a router to another device, or routing updates are not affected by outbound access lists. The
        traffic must flow through the router in order for the router to apply the ACEs.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>24. Consider the access list command applied outbound on a router serial interface.</strong></p>
<pre>access-list 100 deny icmp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any echo reply</pre>
<p><strong>What is the effect of applying this access list command?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The only traffic denied is echo-replies sourced from the 192.168.10.0/24 network. All other traffic is allowed.
    </li>
    <li>The only traffic denied is ICMP-based traffic. All other traffic is allowed.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">No traffic will be allowed outbound on the serial interface.</li>
    <li>Users on the 192.168.10.0/24 network are not allowed to transmit traffic to any other destination.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>25. Which command is used to activate an IPv6 ACL named ENG_ACL on an interface so that the router filters
        traffic prior to accessing the routing table?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>ipv6 access-class ENG_ACL in</li>
    <li>ipv6 traffic-filter ENG_ACL out</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">ipv6 traffic-filter ENG_ACL in</li>
    <li>ipv6 access-class ENG_ACL out</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> For the purpose of applying an access list to a particular interface, the ipv6
        traffic-filter IPv6 command is equivalent to the access-group IPv4 command. The direction in which the traffic
        is examined (in or out) is also required.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>26. What technology has a function of using trusted third-party protocols to issue credentials that are
        accepted as an authoritative identity?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>digital signatures</li>
    <li>hashing algorithms</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">PKI certificates</li>
    <li>symmetric keys</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Digital certificates are used to prove the authenticity and integrity of PKI
        certificates, but a PKI Certificate Authority is a trusted third-party entity that issues PKI certificates. PKI
        certificates are public information and are used to provide authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, and
        nonrepudiation services that can scale to large requirements.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>27. What are two methods to maintain certificate revocation status? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>subordinate CA</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">OCSP</li>
    <li>DNS</li>
    <li>LDAP</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">CRL</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A digital certificate might need to be revoked if its key is compromised or it is
        no longer needed. The certificate revocation list (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), are two
        common methods to check a certificate revocation status.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>28. Which protocol is an IETF standard that defines the PKI digital certificate format?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>SSL/TLS</li>
    <li>X.500</li>
    <li>LDAP</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">X.509</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To address the interoperability of different PKI vendors, IETF published the
        Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification Practices Framework (RFC 2527).

<p><strong>29. A network administrator is configuring DAI on a switch. Which command should be used on the uplink
        interface that connects to a router?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">ip arp inspection trust</li>
    <li>ip dhcp snooping</li>
    <li>ip arp inspection vlan</li>
    <li>spanning-tree portfast</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In general, a router serves as the default gateway for the LAN or VLAN on the
        switch. Therefore, the uplink interface that connects to a router should be a trusted port for forwarding ARP
        requests.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>30. What is the best way to prevent a VLAN hopping attack?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">Disable trunk negotiation for trunk ports and statically set nontrunk ports as access
        ports.</li>
    <li>Disable STP on all nontrunk ports.</li>
    <li>Use VLAN 1 as the native VLAN on trunk ports.</li>
    <li>Use ISL encapsulation on all trunk links.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> VLAN hopping attacks rely on the attacker being able to create a trunk link with a
        switch. Disabling DTP and configuring user-facing ports as static access ports can help prevent these types of
        attacks. Disabling the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) will not eliminate VLAN hopping attacks.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>31. What would be the primary reason an attacker would launch a MAC address overflow attack?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>so that the switch stops forwarding traffic</li>
    <li>so that legitimate hosts cannot obtain a MAC address</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">so that the attacker can see frames that are destined for other hosts</li>
    <li>so that the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the switch</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>32. What is the main difference between the implementation of IDS and IPS devices?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>An IDS can negatively impact the packet flow, whereas an IPS can not.</li>
    <li>An IDS needs to be deployed together with a firewall device, whereas an IPS can replace a firewall.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">An IDS would allow malicious traffic to pass before it is addressed, whereas an IPS stops
        it immediately.</li>
    <li>An IDS uses signature-based technology to detect malicious packets, whereas an IPS uses profile-based
        technology.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> An IPS is deployed in inline mode and will not allow malicious traffic to enter the
        internal network without first analyzing it. An advantage of this is that it can stop an attack immediately. An
        IDS is deployed in promiscuous mode. It copies the traffic patterns and analyzes them offline, thus it cannot
        stop the attack immediately and it relies on another device to take further actions once it detects an attack.
        Being deployed in inline mode, an IPS can negatively impact the traffic flow. Both IDS and IPS can use
        signature-based technology to detect malicious packets. An IPS cannot replace other security devices, such as
        firewalls, because they perform different tasks.</p>

    <li>802.1X support</li>
    <li>separate authentication and authorization processes</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">utilization of transport layer protocols</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Both TACACS+ and RADIUS support password encryption (TACACS+ encrypts all
        communication) and use Layer 4 protocol (TACACS+ uses TCP and RADIUS uses UDP). TACACS+ supports separation of
        authentication and authorization processes, while RADIUS combines authentication and authorization as one
        process. RADIUS supports remote access technology, such as 802.1x and SIP; TACACS+ does not.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>39. What function is provided by the RADIUS protocol?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>RADIUS provides encryption of the complete packet during transfer.</li>
    <li>RADIUS provides separate AAA services.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">RADIUS provides separate ports for authorization and accounting.</li>
    <li>RADIUS provides secure communication using TCP port 49.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When an AAA user is authenticated, RADIUS uses UDP port 1645 or 1812 for
        authentication and UDP port 1646 or 1813 for accounting. TACACS provides separate authorization and accounting
        services. When a RADIUS client is authenticated, it is also authorized. TACACS provides secure connectivity
        using TCP port 49. RADIUS hides passwords during transmission and does not encrypt the complete packet.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>40. What are three characteristics of the RADIUS protocol? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>utilizes TCP port 49</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">uses UDP ports for authentication and accounting</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">supports 802.1X and SIP</li>
    <li>separates the authentication and authorization processes</li>
    <li>encrypts the entire body of the packet</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">is an open RFC standard AAA protocol</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> RADIUS is an open-standard AAA protocol using UDP port 1645 or 1812 for
        authentication and UDP port 1646 or 1813 for accounting. It combines authentication and authorization into one
        process; thus, a password is encrypted for transmission while the rest of the packet will be sent in plain text.
        RADIUS offers the expedited service and more comprehensive accounting desired by remote-access providers but
        provides lower security and less potential for customization than TACACS+.</p>

<ul>
    <li>local zone</li>
    <li>inside zone</li>

    <li>system zone</li>
    <li>outside zone</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Zone-based policy firewalls typically have the private (internal or trusted) zone, the public
        (external or untrusted) zone, and the default self zone, which does not require any interfaces. The private or
        internal zone is commonly used for internal LANs. The public zone would include the interfaces that connect to
        an external (outside the business) interface.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>42. What are two benefits of using a ZPF rather than a Classic Firewall? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>ZPF allows interfaces to be placed into zones for IP inspection.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">The ZPF is not dependent on ACLs.</li>
    <li>Multiple inspection actions are used with ZPF.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">ZPF policies are easy to read and troubleshoot.</li>
    <li>With ZPF, the router will allow packets unless they are explicitly blocked.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> There are several benefits of a ZPF:<br />
        &#8211; It is not dependent on ACLs.<br />
        &#8211; The router security posture is to block unless explicitly allowed.<br />
        &#8211; Policies are easy to read and troubleshoot with C3PL.<br />
        &#8211; One policy affects any given traffic, instead of needing multiple ACLs and inspection actions.</p>

    <li class="correct_answer">Use a keyspace large enough that it takes too much money and too much time to conduct a
        successful attack.</li>
    <li>Use an algorithm that requires the attacker to have both ciphertext and plaintext to conduct a successful
        attack.</li>
    <li>Use frequency analysis to ensure that the most popular letters used in the language are not used in the cipher
        message.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a brute-force attack, an attacker tries every possible key with the decryption
        algorithm knowing that eventually one of them will work. To defend against the brute-force attacks, modern
        cryptographers have as an objective to have a keyspace (a set of all possible keys) large enough so that it
        takes too much money and too much time to accomplish a brute-force attack. A security policy requiring passwords
        to be changed in a predefined interval further defend against the brute-force attacks. The idea is that
        passwords will have been changed before an attacker exhausts the keyspace.</p>

<p><strong>91. What are two disadvantages of using an IDS? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">The IDS does not stop malicious traffic.</li>
    <li>The IDS works offline using copies of network traffic.</li>
    <li>The IDS has no impact on traffic.</li>
    <li>The IDS analyzes actual forwarded packets.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">The IDS requires other devices to respond to attacks.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The disadvantage of operating with mirrored traffic is that the IDS cannot stop
        malicious single-packet attacks from reaching the target before responding to the attack. Also, an IDS often
        requires assistance from other networking devices, such as routers and firewalls, to respond to an attack. An
        advantage of an IDS is that by working offline using mirrored traffic, it has no impact on traffic flow.</p>

    <li>all other ports within the same community</li>
    <li>only isolated ports</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> PVLANs are used to provide Layer 2 isolation between ports within the same
        broadcast domain. The level of isolation can be specified<br />
        with three types of PVLAN ports:<br />
        &#8211; Promiscuous ports that can forward traffic to all other ports<br />

<p><strong>94. A user complains about being locked out of a device after too many unsuccessful AAA login attempts. What
        could be used by the network administrator to provide a secure authentication access method without locking a
        user out of a device?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">Use the login delay command for authentication attempts.</li>
    <li>Use the login local command for authenticating user access.</li>
    <li>Use the aaa local authentication attempts max-fail global configuration mode command with a higher number of
        acceptable failures.</li>
    <li>Use the none keyword when configuring the authentication method list.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The login delay command introduces a delay between failed login attempts without
        locking the account​. This provides a user with unlimited attempts at accessing a device without causing the
        user account to become locked and thus requiring administrator intervention.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>95. What are two drawbacks in assigning user privilege levels on a Cisco router? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Only a root user can add or remove commands.</li>
    <li>Privilege levels must be set to permit access control to specific device interfaces, ports, or slots.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">Assigning a command with multiple keywords allows access to all commands using those
        keywords.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">Commands from a lower level are always executable at a higher level.</li>
    <li>AAA must be enabled.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Privilege levels may not provide desired flexibility and specificity because higher
        levels always inherit commands from lower levels, and commands with multiple keywords give the user access to
        all commands available for each keyword. Privilege levels cannot specify access control to interfaces, ports, or
        slots. AAA is not required to set privilege levels, but is required in order to create role-based views. The
        role of root user does not exist in privilege levels.</p>

<p><strong>97. What are two reasons to enable OSPF routing protocol authentication on a network? (Choose two.)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">to prevent data traffic from being redirected and then discarded</li>
    <li>to ensure faster network convergence</li>
    <li>to provide data security through encryption</li>

    <li>to ensure more efficient routing</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The reason to configure OSPF authentication is to mitigate against routing protocol
        attacks like redirection of data traffic to an insecure link, and redirection of data traffic to discard it.
        OSPF authentication does not provide faster network convergence, more efficient routing, or encryption of data

    <li>Enable SSH on the physical interfaces where the incoming connection requests will be received.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> There are four steps to configure SSH on a Cisco router. First, set the host name and domain
        name. Second, generate a set of RSA keys to be used for encrypting and decrypting the traffic. Third, create the
        user IDs and passwords of the users who will be connecting. Lastly, enable SSH on the vty lines on the router.
        SSH does not need to be set up on any physical interfaces, nor does an external authentication server need to be
        used. While it is a good idea to configure a banner to display legal information for connecting users, it is not
        required to enable SSH.​</p>

    <li class="correct_answer">Filter unwanted traffic before it travels onto a low-bandwidth link.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">Place standard ACLs close to the destination IP address of the traffic.</li>
    <li>Place standard ACLs close to the source IP address of the traffic.</li>
    <li>Place extended ACLs close to the destination IP address of the traffic.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">Place extended ACLs close to the source IP address of the traffic.</li>
    <li>For every inbound ACL placed on an interface, there should be a matching outbound ACL.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Extended ACLs should be placed as close as possible to the source IP address, so that traffic
        that needs to be filtered does not cross the network and use network resources. Because standard ACLs do not
        specify a destination address, they should be placed as close to the destination as possible. Placing a standard
        ACL close to the source may have the effect of filtering all traffic, and limiting services to other hosts.
        Filtering unwanted traffic before it enters low-bandwidth links preserves bandwidth and supports network
        functionality. Decisions on placing ACLs inbound or outbound are dependent on the requirements to be met.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Public and private keys may be used interchangeably.</li>

<ul>
    <li class="correct_answer">SCP</li>
    <li>TFTP</li>
    <li>ACLs on the file server</li>
    <li>out-of-band communication channel</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> File transfer using FTP is transmitted in plain text. The username and password would be
        easily captured if the data transmission is intercepted. Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) conducts the authentication
        and file transfer under SSH, thus the communication is encrypted. Like FTP, TFTP transfers files unencrypted.
        ACLs provide network traffic filtering but not encryption. Using an out-of-band communication channel (OOB)
        either requires physical access to the file server or, if done through the internet, does not necessarily
        encrypt the communication.</p>

<p><strong>145. What are two differences between stateful and packet filtering firewalls? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>A packet filtering firewall will prevent spoofing by determining whether packets belong to an existing

    <li class="correct_answer">A stateful firewall provides more stringent control over security than a packet filtering
        firewall.</li>
    <li>A packet filtering firewall is able to filter sessions that use dynamic port negotiations while a stateful
        firewall cannot.</li>
    <li class="correct_answer">A stateful firewall will provide more logging information than a packet filtering
        firewall.</li>
    <li>A statefull firewall will examine each packet individually while a packet filtering firewall observes the state
        of a connection.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> <em>There are many differences between a stateless and stateful firewall.</em><br />
        <strong>Stateless firewalls (packet filtering firewalls):</strong><br />
        &#8211; are susceptible to IP spoofing<br />
        &#8211; do not reliably filter fragmented packets<br />
        &#8211; use complex ACLs, which can be difficult to implement and maintain<br />
        &#8211; cannot dynamically filter certain services<br />
        &#8211; examine each packet individually rather than in the context of the state of a connection
    </p>
    <p><strong>Stateful firewalls:</strong><br />
        &#8211; are often used as a primary means of defense by filtering unwanted, unnecessary, or undesirable
        traffic<br />
        &#8211; strengthen packet filtering by providing more stringent control over security<br />
        &#8211; improve performance over packet filters or proxy servers<br />
        &#8211; defend against spoofing and DoS attacks by determining whether packets belong to an existing connection
        or are from an unauthorized source<br />
        &#8211; provide more log information than a packet filtering firewall</p>

</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.127 command ignores bit positions 1 through 7, which means that
        addresses 192.168.10.0 through 192.168.10.127 are allowed through. The two ACEs of permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.63
        and permit 192.168.10.64 0.0.0.63 allow the same address range through the router.</p>
