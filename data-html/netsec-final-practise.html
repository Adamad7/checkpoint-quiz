<h3>Network Security (Version 1.0) Practice Final Answers</h3>
<p><strong>1. Which two statements are true about ASA standard ACLs? (Choose two.)​</strong></p>
<div class="92f2483bb651eed307c93e619d752c78" data-index="2"
    style="float: none; margin:10px 0 10px 0; text-align:center;">
    <div id="adngin-incontent_auto_large-0"></div>
</div>

<ul>
    <li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">They identify only the destination IP address. </span></strong></li>
    <li>They are the most common type of ACL.</li>
    <li>They are applied to interfaces to control traffic.</li>
    <li>They specify both the source and destination MAC address.</li>
    <li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">They are typically only used for OSPF routes. </span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> ASA standard ACLs are used to identify the destination IP addresses, unlike IOS
        ACLs where a standard ACL identifies the source host/network. They are typically only used for OSPF routes and
        can be used in a route map for OSPF redistribution. Standard access lists cannot be applied to interfaces to
        control traffic.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>2. When dynamic NAT on an ASA is being configured, what two parameters must be specified by network objects?
        (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>the inside NAT interface</li>
    <li>the interface security level</li>
    <li>the outside NAT interface</li>
    <li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> a range of private addresses that will be translated </span></strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the pool of public global addresses </span></strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> On an ASA, both the pool of addresses that will be used as inside global address
        and the range of internal private addresses that should be translated are configured through network objects.
    </p>
</div>
<p><strong>3. Which protocol uses X.509 certificates to support mail protection performed by mail agents?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>IPsec</li>
    <li>SSL</li>
    <li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> S/MIME </span></strong></li>
    <li>EAP-TLS</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Many applications use the X.509 standard format of digital certificates to
        authenticate websites, public key distribution, and end devices connected to switch ports. User email agents use
        the S/MIME protocol to support email protection. S/MIME uses X.509 certificates.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>4. What are two security features commonly found in a WAN design? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>WPA2 for data encryption of all data between sites</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>firewalls protecting the main and remote sites</strong></span></li>
    <li>outside perimeter security including continuous video surveillance</li>
    <li>port security on all user-facing ports</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>VPNs used by mobile workers between sites</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> WANs span a wide area and commonly have connections from a main site to remote sites
        including a branch office, regional site, SOHO sites, and mobile workers. WANs typically connect over a public
        internet connection. Each site commonly has a firewall and VPNs used by remote workers between sites.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>5. What is an appropriate use for class 5 digital certificates?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>used for online business transactions between companies</li>
    <li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">used for private organizations or government security </span></strong>
    </li>
    <li>used by organizations for which proof of identity is required</li>
    <li>used for testing in situations in which no checks have been performed</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The CA class number determines how rigorous the procedure was that verified the
        identity of the holder when the certificate was issued. The higher the class number, the more trusted the
        certificate. Class numbers range from 0 to 5. A class 5 certificate is the most trusted, and class 0 the least
        trusted. Class 5 is used for private organizations or government security.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>6. Which two statements are characteristics of a virus? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A virus typically requires end-user activation.</strong></span></li>
    <li>A virus has an enabling vulnerability, a propagation mechanism, and a payload.</li>
    <li>A virus replicates itself by independently exploiting vulnerabilities in networks.</li>
    <li>A virus provides the attacker with sensitive data, such as passwords.</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A virus can be dormant and then activate at a specific time or
                date.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The type of end user interaction required to launch a virus is typically opening an
        application, opening a web page, or powering on the computer. Once activated, a virus may infect other files
        located on the computer or other computers on the same network.</p>

    <li>to facilitate the establishment of neighbor adjacencies</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> To configure OSPF MD5 authentication globally, the ip ospf message-digest-key key md5
        password interface configuration command and the area area-id authentication message-digest router configuration
        command are issued. To configure OSPF MD5 authentication per interface, the ip ospf message-digest-key key md5
        password interface configuration command and the ip ospf authentication message-digest interface configuration
        command are issued. Authentication does not encrypt OSPF routing updates. The requirements to establish OSPF
        router neighbor adjacencies are separate from authentication.​</p>

</div>
<p><strong>23. Which statement describes the characteristics of packet-filtering and stateful firewalls as they relate
        to the OSI model?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Both stateful and packet-filtering firewalls can filter at the application layer.</li>
    <li>A stateful firewall can filter application layer information, whereas a packet-filtering firewall cannot filter
        beyond the network layer.</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A packet-filtering firewall typically can filter up to the transport
                layer, whereas a stateful firewall can filter up to the session layer.</strong></span></li>
    <li>A packet-filtering firewall uses session layer information to track the state of a connection, whereas a
        stateful firewall uses application layer information to track the state of a connection.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Packet filtering firewalls can always filter Layer 3 content and sometimes TCP and UDP-based
        content. Stateful firewalls monitor connections and thus have to be able to support up to the session layer of
        the OSI model.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>24. Which special hardware module, when integrated into ASA, provides advanced IPS features?</strong></p>

<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The Cisco ASA assigns security levels to distinguish among different networks it connects.
        Security levels define the level of trustworthiness of an interface. The higher the level, the more trusted the
        interface. The security level numbers range between 0 (untrustworthy) to 100 (very trustworthy). Therefore, the
        interface connecting to the Internet should be assigned the lowest level. The interface connecting to the
        internal network should be assigned the highest level. The interface connecting to the DMZ network should be
        assigned a level between them.</p>

<p><strong>26. What is an advantage in using a packet filtering firewall versus a high-end firewall appliance?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Packet filters perform almost all the tasks of a high-end firewall at a
                fraction of the cost.</strong></span></li>
    <li>Packet filters represent a complete firewall solution.</li>
    <li>Packet filters are not susceptible to IP spoofing.</li>
    <li>Packet filters provide an initial degree of security at the data-link and network layer.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> There are several advantages of using a packet filtering firewall:<br />
        – ​allows for implementing simple permit or deny rule sets.<br />
        – has a low impact on network performance<br />
        – is easy to implement, and is supported by most routers<br />
        – provides an initial degree of security at the network layer<br />
        – performs almost all the tasks of a high-end firewall at a much lower cost</p>
</div>
<p><strong>27. Which type of firewall is commonly part of a router firewall and allows or blocks traffic based on Layer
        3 and Layer 4 information?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>stateless firewall</strong></span></li>
    <li>stateful firewall</li>
    <li>proxy firewall</li>
    <li>application gateway firewall</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> A stateless firewall uses a simple policy table look-up that filters traffic based on
        specific criteria. These firewalls are usually part of a router firewall. They permit or deny traffic based on
        Layer 3 and Layer 4 information.</p>

<p><strong>28. A company is deploying a new network design in which the border router has three interfaces. Interface
        Serial0/0/0 connects to the ISP, GigabitEthernet0/0 connects to the DMZ, and GigabitEthernet/01 connects to the
        internal private network. Which type of traffic would receive the least amount of inspection (have the most
        freedom of travel)?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>traffic that is going from the private network to the DMZ</strong></span>
    </li>
    <li>traffic that originates from the public network and that is destined for the DMZ</li>
    <li>traffic that is returning from the DMZ after originating from the private network</li>
    <li>traffic that is returning from the public network after originating from the private network</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Most traffic within an organization originates from a private IP address. The amount of
        inspection done to that traffic depends on its destination or whether traffic that is going to that private IP
        address originated the connection. The demilitarized zone typically holds servers. Traffic that is destined to
        those servers is filtered based on what services are being provided by the server (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc.).</p>
</div>
<p><strong>29. What are two benefits offered by a zone-based policy firewall on a Cisco router? (Choose two.)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Policies are defined exclusively with ACLs.</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Policies are applied to unidirectional traffic between zones.
            </strong></span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Policies provide scalability because they are easy to read and
                troubleshoot.</strong></span></li>
    <li>Any interface can be configured with both a ZPF and an IOS Classic Firewall.</li>
    <li>Virtual and physical interfaces are put in different zones to enhance security.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> There are several benefits of a ZPF:<br />
        It is not dependent on ACLs.<br />
        The router security posture is to block unless explicitly allowed.<br />
        Policies are easy to read and troubleshoot. This provides scalability because one policy affects any given
        traffic, instead of needing multiple ACLs and inspection actions for different types of traffic.<br />
        Virtual and physical interfaces can be grouped into zones.<br />
        Policies are applied to unidirectional traffic between zones.<br />
        Both IOS Classic Firewalls and ZPFs can be enabled concurrently on a Cisco router. However, the models cannot be
        combined on a single interface.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>30. When a Cisco IOS Zone-Based Policy Firewall is being configured via CLI, which step must be taken after
        zones have been created?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Design the physical infrastructure.</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Establish policies between zones.</strong></span></li>
    <li>Identify subsets within zones.</li>
    <li>Assign interfaces to zones.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The steps for configuring zones in a Zone-Based Policy Firewall are as follows:<br />
        &#8211; Step 1. Determine the zones.<br />
        &#8211; Step 2. Establish policies between zones.<br />

    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Both use signatures to detect malicious traffic.</strong></span></li>
    <li>Both have minimal impact on network performance.​</li>
    <li>Both rely on an additional network device to respond to malicious traffic.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Both the IDS and the IPS are deployed as sensors and use signatures to detect malicious
        traffic. The IDS analyzes copies of network traffic, which results in minimal impact on network performance. The
        IDS also relies on an IPS to stop malicious traffic. ​​</p>
</div>
<p><strong>32. When a Cisco IOS Zone-Based Policy Firewall is being configured, which two actions can be applied to a
        traffic class? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul style="content-visibility: auto;contain-intrinsic-size: auto 156px;">
    <li>log</li>
    <li>hold</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>drop </strong></span></li>

    <li>copy</li>
    <li>forward</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The three actions that can be applied are inspect, drop,and pass.​<br />
        Inspect – This action offers state-based traffic control.<br />
        Drop – This is the default action for all traffic. Similar to the implicit deny any at the end of every ACL,
        there is an explicit drop applied by the IOS to the end of every policy map.<br />
        Pass – This action allows the router to forward traffic from one zone to another.</p>

<p><strong>34. What is a characteristic of an IPS atomic signature?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>it can be slow and inefficient to analyze traffic</li>
    <li>it requires several pieces of data to match an attack</li>
    <li>it is a stateful signature</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>it is the simplest type of signature</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> There are two types of IPS signatures:<br />
        Atomic – This is the simplest type of signature because it does not require the IPS to maintain state
        information and it can identify an attack with a single packet, activity, or event.<br />
        Composite – This is a stateful type of signature. It requires that the IPS maintain state information to match
        an attack signature.</p>

<p><strong>38. A company requires the use of 802.1X security. What type of traffic can be sent if the authentication
        port-control auto command is configured, but the client has not yet been authenticated?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>SNMP</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>EAPOL</strong></span></li>
    <li>broadcasts such as ARP</li>
    <li>any data encrypted with 3DES or AES</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> 802.1X prevents unauthorized devices from gaining access to the network. The authentication
        port-control auto command turns on 802.1X access control. Until the client is authenticated, 802.1X only allows
        Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPOL), Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), and Spanning Tree Protocol
        (STP) traffic to pass through the port. EAPOL messages are sent between the client and the authenticator such as
        a switch. If authentication is successful, normal traffic can be sent and received through the port.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>39. Which two security features can cause a switch port to become error-disabled? (Choose two.)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>root guard</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>PortFast with BPDU guard enabled</strong></span></li>
    <li>protected ports</li>
    <li>storm control with the trap option</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>port security with the shutdown violation mode</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Error-disabled mode is a way for a switch to automatically shut down a port that is causing
        problems, and usually requires manual intervention from an administrator to restore the port. When port security
        is configured to use the shutdown violation mode, it will put the port into the error-disabled mode when the
        maximum number of MAC addresses is exceeded. Likewise, BPDU guard will put the port into error-disabled mode if
        a BPDU arrives on a PortFast enabled interface. Storm control will only put the port into the error-disabled
        mode when configured with the shutdown option. The trap option will simply create an SNMP log message.</p>
