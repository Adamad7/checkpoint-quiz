<p><strong>1. Which industry-standard method has created a catalog of known vulnerabilities that provides a score indicating the severity of a vulnerability?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="correct_answer">CVSS</li>
<li>CVE</li>
<li>OWASP WSTG</li>
<li>NIST SP 800-115</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success"><p><b>Explanation:</b> Vulnerability scanners rely heavily on catalogs of known vulnerabilities. The two catalogs of known vulnerabilities that a cybersecurity analyst should be familiar with are the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which provides a score from 0 to 10 that indicates the severity of a vulnerability, and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), which is a list of publicly known vulnerabilities, each assigned an ID number, description, and reference. OWASP WSTG is a comprehensive guide focused on web application testing. NIST SP 800-115 is a document to provide organizations with guidelines on planning and conducting information security testing.</p></div>
